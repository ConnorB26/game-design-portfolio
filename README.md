# [Bowling Game Design](https://bowlinggamedesign.com/) - Connor Bowling's Game Design Portfolio

Welcome to Connor Bowling's Game Design Portfolio, a showcase of my most accomplished video game projects. I created this site as a personal project to learn React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and to present my work in a professional manner. While this project is purely front-end—since it only displays pictures, videos, and text without the need for a back-end or database—it still serves as an excellent learning experience in a field I hadn't explored before. As I continue to develop more games, I plan to update this website regularly.

### Overcoming Design Challenges

As a programmer, I'm highly proficient in creating content with HTML and JavaScript. However, I faced challenges in designing the website's layout, colors, and styling due to my limited artistic capabilities. There was even a time when I redesigned the entire website, only to scrap it after hours of work because it didn't meet my expectations.

To overcome these challenges, I turned to online resources for help. I found tools that provided color palettes and allowed me to create a visual layout using drag-and-drop features. These tools enabled me to generate the necessary CSS to style my website the way I envisioned it.

### Lessons Learned & Future Improvements

This project taught me valuable lessons in React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while also helping me improve my design skills. As I continue to work on new games, I plan to refine and update this portfolio site to reflect my growth as a game designer and developer. By exploring new tools and resources, I hope to keep enhancing my design abilities and deliver a visually appealing, user-friendly experience for visitors.
