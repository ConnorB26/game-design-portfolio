# [Bowling Game Design](https://bowlinggamedesign.com/) - Connor Bowling's Game Design Portfolio

This site was designed as a personal project to learn React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and as a way to formally display my most completed video game projects in a more professional manner. This project ended up being purely front-end since I'm only just showing pictures, videos, text, etc., and have no need for an internal database or any kind of back-end processing. However, it was still a great learning excerise in a field I hadn't quite dabbled in yet and I plan to continually update this website as I make more games.

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

My main issue when creating and now updating this website is my lack of artistic capabilities. I'm a programmer first and so although creating the content with HTML and JavaScript wasn't much of a challenge for me, designing the layout, colors, and styling, was really difficult. I once re-designed the entire website layout, color palette, etc., didn't like it after many hours of work, and simply deleted it all. To help myself with this issue, I found some online resources to get a color palette and other tools where I could layout how I wanted my site to look with drag and drop features, then copy some of the CSS necessary to make my content look like I wanted it to.
